# Multimodal-Sense-AI

A deep learning framework designed for **unified perception** by integrating vision, text, and acoustic data streams. This project focuses on cross-modal data fusion to enhance decision-making accuracy and environmental awareness.

## Key Technical Features

* **Unified Perception**: Synchronized processing of multiple input modalities for a holistic understanding of the surroundings.
* **Feature-Level Fusion**: Integration of feature vectors from disparate encoders into a single, cohesive decision-making layer.
* **Low-Latency Architecture**: Focus on efficient processing of vision and audio streams for real-time applications.
* **Dataset Engineering**: Specialized pipelines for synchronizing and normalizing multimodal data.
