# Multimodal-Sense-AI

A deep learning framework designed for **unified perception** by integrating vision, text, and acoustic data streams. The project focuses on cross-modal data fusion techniques to enhance decision-making accuracy and situational awareness in real-time environments.

## Key Technical Features

* **Unified Perception**: Synchronized processing of multiple input modalities for a holistic understanding of the environment.
* **Feature-Level Fusion**: Integration of high-dimensional feature vectors from disparate encoders into a single, cohesive decision-making layer.
* **Low-Latency Architecture**: Performance-optimized processing of video and audio streams, tailored for automation and robotics applications.
* **Dataset Engineering**: Specialized pipelines for the synchronization, normalization, and augmentation of multimodal datasets.

## Project Structure & File Descriptions

* **`main.py`** (lub Twoja nazwa pliku): The core execution script that orchestrates the data flow, model initialization, and the multimodal inference process.
* **`music_neural_network.py`**: Implementation of a specialized neural network architecture for high-level acoustic feature extraction.
* **`/models`**: Directory containing specialized encoder architectures for Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
* **`/preprocessing`**: Utility scripts for MFCC extraction, image normalization, and text tokenization.

## Network Architecture: Music Neural Network

The model implemented in `music_neural_network.py` is an optimized architecture for acoustic signal analysis. The network utilizes the following components:
